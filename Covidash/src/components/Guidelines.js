            <h2>Three Important Ways to Slow the Spread</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                Wear a mask to protect yourself and others and stop the spread
                of COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from others who don’t
                live with you, particularly in crowded areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand
                sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Protect Yourself When Going Out</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect
                yourself and others. Choose a mask with two or more layers of
                washable, breathable fabric that fits snugly against the sides
                of your face.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stay 6 feet apart and avoid crowds. The more people you are in
                contact with, the more likely you are to be exposed to COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
                Avoid indoor spaces as much as possible, particularly ones that
                aren’t well ventilated. You may find it harder to stay 6 feet
                apart in indoor spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wash your hands often. Use soap and water for 20 seconds,
                especially after you have been in a public place or hand
                sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.

            <h2>If You are at Risk of Getting Very Sick</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                People of any age can get COVID-19, even healthy young adults
                and children.
            </p>
            <p>
                People who are older or have certain underlying medical
                conditions are at higher risk of getting very sick from
                COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other groups may be at higher risk for getting COVID-19 or
                having more severe illness.

            <h2>What to Do If You're Sick</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                Stay home except to get medical care. Most people with COVID-19
                have mild illness and recover at home without medical care.
            </p>
            <p>
                Isolate yourself from other members of your family to prevent
                spread to them and the people that they may have contact with,
                like grandparents. If you have to leave isolation, wear a mask,
                stay 6 feet apart from others, wash your hands frequently, and
                clean all touched surfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if you don’t feel sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others.
                Be sure that you protect everyone as though they are the most
                fragile person in your family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get care immediately if you are having emergency warning signs,
                like trouble breathing, pain or pressure in chest.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Get a Test for Current Infection</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                You can visit your state or local health department’s website to
                look for the latest local information on testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call
                your healthcare provider first.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and choose to not get tested,
                it is important to stay home. Find out what to do if you are
                sick.
