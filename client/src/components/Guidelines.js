			<h1>Things to Know about the COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
			<br />
			<h2>Three Important Ways to Slow the Spread</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Wear a mask to protect yourself and others and stop the spread of
				COVID-19.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from others who don’t live
				with you, particularly in crowded areas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer
				with at least 60% alcohol.
			</p>
			<br />
			<hr />
			<br />
			<h2>How to Protect Yourself When Going Out</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and
				others. Choose a mask with two or more layers of washable, breathable
				fabric that fits snugly against the sides of your face.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stay 6 feet apart and avoid crowds. The more people you are in contact
				with, the more likely you are to be exposed to COVID-19.
			</p>
			<p>
				Avoid indoor spaces as much as possible, particularly ones that aren’t
				well ventilated. You may find it harder to stay 6 feet apart in indoor
				spaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wash your hands often. Use soap and water for 20 seconds, especially
				after you have been in a public place or hand sanitizer if soap and
				water aren’t available.
			</p>
			<br />

			<br />
			<h2>If You are at Risk of Getting Very Sick</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				People of any age can get COVID-19, even healthy young adults and
				children.
			</p>
			<p>
				People who are older or have certain underlying medical conditions are
				at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other groups may be at higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having more
				severe illness.
			</p>
			<br />
			<hr />
			<br />
			<h2>What to Do If You're Sick</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Stay home except to get medical care. Most people with COVID-19 have
				mild illness and recover at home without medical care.
			</p>
			<p>
				Isolate yourself from other members of your family to prevent spread to
				them and the people that they may have contact with, like grandparents.
				If you have to leave isolation, wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart from
				others, wash your hands frequently, and clean all touched surfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if you don’t feel sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. Be sure
				that you protect everyone as though they are the most fragile person in
				your family.
			</p>
			<p>
				Get care immediately if you are having emergency warning signs, like
				trouble breathing, pain or pressure in chest.
			</p>
			<br />

			<br />
			<h2>How to Get a Test for Current Infection</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				You can visit your state or local health department’s website to look
				for the latest local information on testing.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your
				healthcare provider first.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and choose to not get tested, it is
				important to stay home. Find out what to do if you are sick.
			</p>
			<br />

			<br />
			<h2>How to Cope with Stress</h2>
			<br />
			<p>Care for yourself one small way each day.</p>
			<p>Unwind by doing yoga, listening to music, or gardening.</p>
			<p>
				Find new ways to connect with family and friends, get support, and share
				feelings.
			</p>
			<p>Eat healthy foods and get enough rest</p>
			<p>Relax by reading, listening to music, or starting a new hobby.</p>
			<br />
			<hr />
			<br />
